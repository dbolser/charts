# MetalLB Basic Setup

You install and configure MetalLB like any other app.

This guide will allow you to assigning different IP addresses to each app (instead of putting each app on a different 'node port').

:::info

We assume a single address pool on a layer 2 network.

:::

:::warning

With MetalLB installed, apps will not be reachable using the integrated LoadBalancer. You cannot combine two different LoadBalancers in TrueNAS SCALE.

:::

## Prerequisites

- Add the Operators & Enterprise trains to your TrueCharts Catalog.

![metallb-addtrains](img/metallb_guide_trains.png)

:::caution

Our customized version of MetalLB is only intended for use with other TrueCharts applications. Other catalogs will likely not support our MetalLB application. MetalLB could technically work with TrueNAS catalog apps if they used the LoadBalancer service, but they don't as they use NodePort instead. These atypical configurations aren't officially supported nor encouraged by TrueCharts.

:::

## 1. Install MetalLB

![metallb-apps](img/metallb_guide_apps.png)

First, install `metallb` (from the operators train). There is no config, so just hit save.

:::info

If you encounter an error upon install, run the following command as root from system settings -> shell and attempt the install again:
`k3s kubectl delete --grace-period 30 --v=4 -k https://github.com/truecharts/manifests/delete`

If you previously had `metallb` installed and encounter an error, delete the old version, then run the above command before proceeding to install the `metallb` operator.

:::

Next, install and configure MetalLB-Config, as described below.

## 2. Set Address Pool & L2 Advertisement in MetalLB-Config

Click to install `metallb-config` (from enterprise train).

First create a new entry under `Configure IP Address Pools Object`

![metallb-addpoolbasic](img/metallb_guide_addresspool_basic.png)

- **Name**: Enter a general name for this IP range. Something like _apps_ or _charts_ for this field is fine.
- **Auto Assign**: if you want MetalLB Services to auto-assign IPs from the configured address pool without needing to specify per app. Recommendation is to keep this checked. You can still specify an IP for apps as needed (see step 3).

Next, create an entry under `Configure Address Pools`

- **Address Pool Entry:** Specify an IP range for MetalLB to assign IPs that is **OUTSIDE** your current DHCP range on your LAN. Typically you can check your routers admin panel for details. For example, if your router's DHCP range is `192.168.1.100-192.168.1.255`, then your entry can be any range below `192.168.1.100`, e.g. `192.168.1.10-192.168.1.99`. This entry can also be specified in CIDR format.

_For users with VLANs or multiple subnets, you may create create additional address pool objects as needed._

Next, create a new entry under `Configure L2 Advertisements`.

![metallb-l2advertisement](img/metallb_guide_l2advertisement.png)

- **Name**: Enter a basic name for your layer 2 advertisement.
- **Address Pool Entry:** This should match the **name** of the address pool created above (not the IP range itself).

Finally, click Save!

:::info

Once installed, `metallb-config` will always show as Stopped.

:::

## 3. Optional: Specify IP Address per App or Service

With MetalLB installed, it's recommended (but optional) to specify IP specific addresses for your apps when you install and configure them.

![metallb-specifyIP](img/metallb_guide_specifyIP.png)

When configuring each app, look under **Networking and Services**, select the `LoadBalancer` Service Type for the Main Service.

In the **LoadBalancer IP** field, specify an IP address that is within the MetalLB address pool that you configured above. Apply the same IP address to the **LoadBalancer IP** field on other services within the app.

## 4. Disable SCALE's Default LoadBalancer

With MetalLB installed and configured, you must now disable SCALE's default LoadBalancer.

In the SCALE UI, under **Apps** > **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**

![metallb-disable](img/metallb_guide_disableLB.png)

Uncheck `Enable Integrated LoadBalancer`.

**This will trigger a restart of Kubernetes and all apps**. After roughly 5-10 minutes, your apps will redeploy using the MetalLB-assigned IP addresses.

## 5. Verify IP Addresses Are Assigned

From your SCALE shell, run the command `k3s kubectl get svc -A` to verify the IP addresses assigned for each of your apps. The IPs will be listed under the `EXTERNAL-IP` column.

If you have an IP conflict with a previously assigned address it will show as `<pending>`.

**You may need to do a system reboot as well to properly resolve the conflict.**

:::caution

Known Issue: On the SCALE Installed Applications page, the **Open** buttons on each app card will still open a URL to your app using your SCALE Host IP, rather than the MetalLB-Assigned IP. This may be resolved in the future.
